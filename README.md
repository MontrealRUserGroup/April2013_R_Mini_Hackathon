Please upload a folder to this repository containing:

* a basic script to access the online data from R
  * (so that most of the time is spent playing with the data not scrapping/getting it into R)
* a pdf of your presentation (max 5 slides) containing a relevant question to be asked of the data
  * (so that we may combine all presentations for smooth sailing)

Looking forward to hacking at this data with all of you!
