Come hack with us!  We would love for you to propose data and a related question. Prize for best data and question!

** Please upload a folder to this repository containing:**

* a basic script to access the online data from R
  * (so that most of the time is spent playing with the data not scrapping/getting it into R)
* a pdf of your presentation (max 5 slides) containing a relevant question to be asked of the data
  * (so that we may combine all presentations for smooth sailing)

Looking forward to hacking at this data with all of you!
