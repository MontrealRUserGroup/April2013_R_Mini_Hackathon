Bicycle Accidents in Montreal 2006-2010
=======================================

Some data obtained and compiled by Roberta Rocha at the Montreal Gazette. I've done a [visualization](http://bayesianbiologist.com/2012/09/14/mapping-bike-accidents-in-r/) of this data showing the accidents in time and space.

Some questions we might ask of this data:

* Can we predict accident rates?
* Spatial patterns? Dangerous areas?
* Does the construction holiday have an effect on accident rates?
